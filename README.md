# Accomplish

I built this site to polish my frontend skills and learn modern CSS techniques, focusing on responsive design using **Tailwind CSS** and animations with **Framer Motion**.

A special thanks to the [Frontend Tribe YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@frontend-tribe) for their fantastic tutorial that helped guide me through this project!

Note: This project is not finished yet...
